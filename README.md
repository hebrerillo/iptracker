## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Leaflet
- Geo Ipify


### What I learned

Thanks to this project, I have strengthened my JavaScript skills, especially when working with asynchronous JavaScript, something very hard.

### Continued development

I am not good at UI/UX at all. When the user inputs an invalid IP or domain, I added a box showing the error with a crying face. The design of this box can be improved tremendously, but I do not know how to do it.


### Useful resources

- https://leafletjs.com - This helped me to build the map very easily.
- https://geo.ipify.org - This helped me to get all of the needed information about IP addresses.
